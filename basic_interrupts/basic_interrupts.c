//The correct place to call request_irq is when the device is first opened, before the
//hardware is instructed to generate interrupts.
//The place to call free_irq is the last
//time the device is closed, after the hardware is told not to interrupt the processor any
//more.
//For what itâ€™s worth, the i386 and x86_64 architectures define a function for querying
//the availability of an interrupt line:
//int can_request_irq(unsigned int irq, unsigned long flags);
//This function returns a nonzero value if an attempt to allocate the given interrupt succeeds.
//Note, however, that things can always change between calls to can_request_irq
//and request_irq
